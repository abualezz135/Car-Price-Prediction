Project Description:

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict car prices based on a set of features such as brand, model, year, engine, and mileage. The process involves analyzing historical car data and training several classification models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest. The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics like prediction accuracy and confusion matrix to ensure the accuracy of the predictions.
